# ADSS-Final-Group-Project
This assignment was given in our Advanced Data Structures and Storage class and involved us to create a simple web that displays information for several cryptocurrencies.

This web page had to be developed using PythonAnywhere with Python version 3.10. The libraries we used included flask, pandas, tinydb and os.

# Installation:
1. First download the zip file from GitHub containing the readme file, the flask app file and the index.html file.
2. Extract them to a folder and run the flask app python file, which will consequently create the dataset in tinydb.
3. Finally upload the index.html file to the templates folder within the website directories in PythonAnywhere, which will consequently run the app.

# Use:
Replace any "_name_" in the code with the name of your app
